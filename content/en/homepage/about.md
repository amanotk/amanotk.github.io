## About Me
I am an associate professor at [Department of Earth and Planetary Science][2], [Graduate School of Science][1], the Univesity of Tokyo.
Please refer the list of of publicaions on [Google Scholar][4] or in [CV][6] (PDF, including list of publications) for details of my research activity.

## Research Area
- Space Physics
- Plasma Astrophysics

## Research Interests
I am interested in theoretical aspects of space and astrophysical plasma phenomena.  My major research interests include physics of collisionless shocks (both non-relativistic and relativistic regimes), high-energy particle acceleration and transport, linear and nonlinear theory for kinetic plasma instabilities, and numerical techniques for advanced kinetic/fluid plasma simulations.
