The auroral brightness of 5 kR is unusual for the Dst index peak of only -107 nT. In spite of the moderate storm amplitude, the extremely high solar wind density of {$>$}50/cc and dynamic pressure of {$>$}25 nPa caused the aurora oval extension to 53 magnetic latitudes (L = 2.8). We discuss that the drift loss of the ring current particles across the small-size magnetopause is important, and Hokkaido was at the right position to see the direct effect of the large particle injection of the storm-time substorm.},
